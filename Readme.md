**Neofetch** is a command-line utility for Linux, macOS, and other Unix-like operating systems that displays system information in a visually appealing way, often alongside a logo or ASCII art. It’s commonly used to show off system details and is popular for screenshots, particularly within the Linux community.

### Key Features of Neofetch:
1. **System Information Display**: Neofetch provides detailed information about your system, including OS, kernel, uptime, packages, shell, resolution, DE (desktop environment), CPU, GPU, memory usage, and more.

2. **Highly Customizable Output**: You can control what information Neofetch displays by modifying its configuration file. This makes it easy to create a unique output that shows only the details you care about.

3. **ASCII Logos for Popular Distros**: One of Neofetch’s standout features is its support for ASCII art logos for hundreds of Linux distributions, as well as some non-Linux operating systems. You can even customize it to show logos from other distros or custom artwork.

4. **Minimal Resource Usage**: Neofetch is lightweight and doesn’t consume significant system resources, making it an ideal tool for frequent use, even on low-spec devices.

5. **Customization Options**: It offers options for customizing ASCII colors, adding text, and modifying alignment. You can even replace the ASCII art logo with an image if you’re using an image-compatible terminal.

### Advanced Usage:
- **Scripting**: Neofetch can be integrated into scripts to collect and display system information in more complex workflows, such as server monitoring.
- **Alternative Logos**: You can use the `--ascii_distro` option to display the logo of another distro, and `--ascii_colors` to customize the colors.
- **Display Only Logo**: Using `--logo`, you can hide system information and only show the logo, which is useful for aesthetic purposes in screenshots.

### Why Use Neofetch?
Neofetch is widely used by Linux enthusiasts and content creators on platforms like YouTube to showcase their setups, add a professional look to their screens, or simply express their affinity for their favorite distributions.
